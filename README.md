# Power BI Carnival Data Project

This repository contains the Power BI project developed to analyze and visualize Carnival-related data using Excel datasets from 2022 to 2025.  
The dashboards provide insights into street blocks, samba schools, geographic distribution, operational metrics, and year-over-year trends.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to consolidate multiple Excel datasets and transform them into interactive dashboards in Power BI.  
The analysis includes:

- Street blocos (Blocos de Rua)
- Samba schools
- Geographic mapping of neighborhoods
- Time‑based comparisons using a custom Dim_Tempo table
- Consolidated insights from operational datasets
- KPIs, comparative visuals, and historical trends (2022–2025)

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources

The project uses the following Excel files:

- `Carnaval_Dados.csv`
- `Carnaval_Dados_Consolidados_2022-2025.xlsx`
- `mapa.xlsx`
- `Orgaos_Descricao.csv`
- `suporte_BI_ibmec.xlsx`

Each dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query before being used in the Power BI model.
